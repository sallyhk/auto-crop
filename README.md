# auto_crop
A python program that auto-crops a .png file with white background around one main non-white image.

# Overview
Created initially to remove white background margin around a fingerprint and potential "smudges" (partial fingerprints produced from accidental fumbling), the program crops around one main non-white image. 

# Getting Started
First, open the terminal and `cd` into the directory where you would like to download this program.
Then, clone the auto_crop repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sallykim515/auto_crop.git
```
Put .png file to crop inside the auto_crop folder. Note the filename.
Use the following command to run the program:
```
python sample.py
```
When prompted, enter the input filename noted from above. 
That's it! :)
